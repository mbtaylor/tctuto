Suggested plan for a 2 hour tutorial:

   - Start with a 10 minutes introduction
      - What is TOPCAT, what it does, what it doesn't do
      - What is STILTS
      - What is the virtual observatory
      - What is Gaia
      - How the tutorial will be run

   - For each section:
      - 15-20 minutes: let the students follow the script
      - 5-10 minutes: tutor goes through the exercise at fairly high speed
           showing what it should look like

Probably 4 sections is the most that's feasible in two hours.
If you have longer, you might want to allow more time for each section.
You can choose if you want to include STILTS or not.

Other ways to run it are possible, e.g. tutor goes through the whole
thing in detail, at about 15-20 minutes per section.
In that case the students can optionally attempt to follow hands-on
simultaneously, or they can have a few minutes at the end to have a go.
